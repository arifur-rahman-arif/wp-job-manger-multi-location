# The _Multi Location for WP Job Manager_ plugin.

<br/>

## A brief description about this plugin:

It wasn't possible to add more than one marker or location in _WP Job Manager_ with _WP Job Manager_ extended location plugin. This plugin makes this happen. You can simply install and activate it. No other changes required. You will see a multi-location button to add as many locations as you need for the listing.

The multi-location plugin adds the ability to add as many markers as you want. Multi-location marker shows in single listing page as well as in the explore or search map.

This plugin has the following dependencies:

-   WP Job Manager plugin
-   WP Job Manager - Extended Location plugin
-   WP Job Manager addon - Jobs Geolocation plugin.
